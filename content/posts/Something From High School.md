Hi, this is just a short rant of a thing that has contributed to my life and i don't even look at the screen while typing, so feel free to close this post.

When i was in the high school i have done many stupid and embarassing things, i did this, i did that, and i did those.

The annoying thing is that the cringe thing is almost always haunting my head everyday. And when that happen i often lowering my head, closing eyes tightly and speaking silently like "why am i doing that?, why am i talking like that?, why i get carried away?, Why didn't i think twice?, how my crush think after i'm doing that?, why didn't i do it sooner?, ~~why ****** just after graduate?~~" and after that i let out a long sigh and then the cringe thing hit my head again for a few times.

This still the case today and it always ruined my day, i don't know how to get rid of this cringe and i just try to get used to it.

Fortunately, the memory that hit my head is not just cringe thing, but also a good and sweet memory. Like when i hang out with my friends and have a lot of fun, when my friends talking about crazy stuff, when the conversation between me and someone so seamless, when she is there and the atmosfer is changing and my ear feels hot, when i help someone or someone help me. And it's make me feel that i'm not too bad as a person.

Thank you for all people and all other species on the school who have contributed directly or indirectly to my life, thank you for the memories and thank you for being there.
