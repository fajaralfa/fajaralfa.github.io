Hi, i'm Fajar.

I am a student who just graduated from vocational high school, majoring software engineering. I learn a lot back then, and still.  
I love programming, robotic and computer in general because it's a cool and useful things.  
I have created several application that not very useful but really help me to learn, and people can see it on my github.  
I also have a blog and youtube channel that talk about tutorial, technology, and some random thing.
